# NFT-Rexx

This repository includes python3 scripts used to generate T-Rex's and upload them to OpenSea. Inspired by [NFTBirds](https://twitter.com/NFTBirds) and [DynoBits](https://twitter.com/dyno_bits), I have made my code open source! The code is licensed under the BSD-3 license. I am not a professional programmer and am self-taught so while my scripts might not be pretty or efficient, hopefully they will be useful to you. I cannot promise to be able to answer all questions, but if something comes up the best place to ask questions is my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NFT_Rexx). If it has been helpful for you, consider checking out my [OpenSea page](https://opensea.io/collection/nft-rexx)!

If you feel compelled to send ETH or NFTs to me directly, please know that it is not necessary, but the NFT-Rexx project wallet address is: 0xA4cEDeb211D0B863081aae5C9332d7808f2ac2f0
